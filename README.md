Code and data used in paper arXiv:2212.13488

Plots_ERG contain code use to generate plots containing energy and/or ergotropy values for specific dynamics. A minimal description of  the data used is contained in the notebook.

Plots_NM contain code use to generate plots containing geometrical measure of non-Markovianity for specific dynamics. A minimal description of  the data used is contained in the notebook.

Coll_Model contains the code used to simulate the dynamics for given parameters and to evaluate the system's energy, ergotropy and geometric measure of non-Markovianity.
